# General Assembly Capstone Project: Kiva Loans
This repository contains the code for my Capstone project on the 2 million dataset [made available](https://www.kiva.org/build/data-snapshots) by Kiva, undertaken as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course between November 2020 and February 2021. This project consisted in predicting loans which would 'expire', or in other words those who don't reach their fundraising target in the website, in order to subsequently promote them. 

## Problem Statement:
On Kiva.org, most loans reach their fundraising target. I would like to understand why some don't reach their target, for example if it's due to gender or location or something more troublesome like repayment rates. If it's not due to repayment rates, then we could maybe promote those that are likely to expire, as these loans can be repaid and it is a sad end for the borrower. So I will first try and make a model without repayment rates, then add these to the model to see how the results change and the inferences we can make from this.

## [Part 1: Cleaning](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/project/project-capstone/Capstone%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
- Perform preliminary data munging and cleaning of your data: removing nulls, reducing value counts, feature extractions. 
- Removing unnecessary rows and columns.

## [Part 2: EDA and Preprocessing]( https://github.com/nicolas1998v/KivaCapstoneProject/blob/main/EDA%20-%20NLP.ipynb)
- Quantitatively visualise your data, looking at each values correlation with the target variable. 
- Perform Natural Language Processing on the text variables, and dummify the object columns.

## [Part 3: Modelling](https://github.com/nicolas1998v/KivaCapstoneProject/blob/main/Modelling.ipynb) 
- Detail your model and approach with concisely commented code. 
- Evaluate model performance and discuss results. 

## [Part 4: Presentation]( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18hdJlMiIoCoKHjRcSIvIPgoN-mT_E5lz_FUGBUjFQaU/edit#slide=id.p)
- Host a short, well rehearsed presentation of your project for a non-technical audience. 
- Cover goals, success criteria, data, approach, basic description of model, findings, risks/limitations, impact, next steps and conclusions.
